{"title":"BRCA1 SGE Exon 3 Replicate 1","methodText":"Illumina bcl2fastq v2.16 was used to call bases and demultiplex samples. Sample quality was assessed using fastqc v0.11.3. SeqPrep was used to trim adapters and merge overlapping read pairs. Reads containing “N” bases wer eremoved. Reads were aligned to the BRCA1 gDNA using Needleman-Wunsch in EMBOSS v6.4.0. Reads were counted if an HDR marker edit was observed. All counts received a pseudocount of 1.\r\n\r\nThe `score_raw` is the log2-transformed ratio of frequencies of the variant at day 11 over the input. The `score_day5` is the log2-transformed ratio of frequencies of the variant at day 5 over the input. The day 5 scores were used to perform a LOESS regression to normalize based on genomic position. This model was fit on the day 5 data and the model’s output was subtracted from the day 11 log ratios, producing the `score` here. The `score_rna` is the day 5 cDNA frequency over the gDNA frequency.","abstractText":"This dataset contains the pre-normalization scores for BRCA1 saturation genome editing (SGE) data from exon 3, replicate 1.

These contained the SNV edits being assayed and a fixed synonymous substitution to prevent re-editing by Cas9 after successful repair. HAP1 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid containing Cas9 and a guide RNA. Cells were grown and sampled at 5 days and 11 days. The 5 day time point was used to correct for positional bias in the function scores and for calculating RNA scores. The 11 day time point was used to calculate function scores. Samples were sequenced using Illumina NextSeq or MiSeq platform.","extraMetadata":{},"urn":"urn:mavedb:00000097-c","createdBy":{"orcidId":"0000-0003-1474-605X","firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Rubin"},"modifiedBy":{"orcidId":"0000-0003-1474-605X","firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Rubin"},"creationDate":"2022-07-22","modificationDate":"2022-07-22","publishedDate":"2022-07-22","experimentSetUrn":"urn:mavedb:00000097","scoreSetUrns":["urn:mavedb:00000097-c-1"],"doiIdentifiers":[],"primaryPublicationIdentifiers":[{"identifier":"30209399","id":75,"url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30209399","referenceHtml":"Findlay GM, <i>et al</i>.
