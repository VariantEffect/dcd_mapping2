Each library contained 50,000-2,000,000 constructs per target, which included nearly all possible single nucleotide changes as well as many single base pair deletions. Variants were tagged with 15 or 20 base pair barcodes 3' of the target region. Promoters were inserted into pGL4.11 vectors and enhancers were inserted into pGL4.23 enhancers such that they would drive expression of the luciferase reporter gene. RNA barcodes were counted using targeted RT-PCR and Illumina sequencing, and DNA barcodes were counted using targeted PCR and Illumina sequencing. Long variant sequences were associate with barcodes using subassembly.\r\n\r\nAs described by <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/505362v1>","extraMetadata":{},"urn":"urn:mavedb:00000018-a","createdBy":{"orcidId":"0000-0003-1474-605X","firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Rubin"},"modifiedBy":{"orcidId":"0000-0002-2032-6679","firstName":"Max","lastName":"Schubach"},"creationDate":"2019-02-19","modificationDate":"2019-11-21","publishedDate":"2019-02-19","experimentSetUrn":"urn:mavedb:00000018","scoreSetUrns":["urn:mavedb:00000018-a-1"],"doiIdentifiers":[{"identifier":"10.1038/s41467-019-11526-w","id":1,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11526-w"},{"identifier":"10.17605/OSF.IO/75B2M","id":2,"url":"https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/75B2M"}],"primaryPublicationIdentifiers":[{"identifier":"31395865","id":21,"url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31395865","referenceHtml":"Kircher M, <i>et al</i>.
