Eight mutant pools were generated—corresponding to amino acids 458–466, 467–476, 477–486, 501–510, 511–520, 527–536, 579–587, and 588–596—in which each amino acid was mutated to all possible 64 codons. The mutant pools were transferred into a retroviral vector containing BRAFV600E and then stably transduced into the human melanoma cell line A375.\r\n\r\nAfter transfection with mutant BRAF, cells were treated with vemurafenib. Cells surviving vemurafenib treatment were then sequenced to determine the enrichment of resistance mutations.","extraMetadata":{},"urn":"urn:mavedb:00000091-a","createdBy":{"orcidId":"0000-0003-1474-605X","firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Rubin"},"modifiedBy":{"orcidId":"0000-0003-1474-605X","firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Rubin"},"creationDate":"2021-11-13","modificationDate":"2021-11-13","publishedDate":"2021-11-13","experimentSetUrn":"urn:mavedb:00000091","scoreSetUrns":["urn:mavedb:00000091-a-1"],"doiIdentifiers":[],"primaryPublicationIdentifiers":[{"identifier":"24112705","id":71,"url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24112705","referenceHtml":"Wagenaar TR, <i>et al</i>.
