{"title":"Enrich scores for E4B","methodText":"Scores were calculated using the Enrich software package, corrected for nonspecific carryover as described in (1). Uncorrected log2 enrichment ratios are also provided. This dataset used only the variant counts in the input and round 3 selected time points as the basis for the log ratio scoring.","abstractText":"This study identified multiple gain-of-function mutations in the ubiquitination factor E4B U-box domain by measuring auto-ubiquitination in a phage display system. E4B is an E3 ligase, responsible for transferring a ubiquitin from an E2 ligase to the target (in this case the phage displaying E4B). Many of these mutations are not specific to one E2 enzyme and so may be generalizable for mutiple E2s and E3s.","shortDescription":"Scores as presented in Starita et al. 2013, analyzed using the Enrich software package.","extraMetadata":{},"dataUsagePolicy":null,"keywords":["U-box","E3","Phage display","log ratios","ubiquitin"],"urn":"urn:mavedb:00000004-a-1","numVariants":98298,"experiment":{"title":"Deep mutational scan of E4B (Ube4b) U-box domain auto-ubiquitination","shortDescription":"Deep mutational scan of the murine E4B (Ube4b) U-box domain using a phage display auto-ubiquitination assay.","abstractText":"This study identified multiple gain-of-function mutations in the ubiquitination factor E4B U-box domain by measuring auto-ubiquitination in a phage display system.

The phage display was performed using T7 phage and selected for Flag-Ub binding to anti-Flag beads. Full-length variant sequences were associated with 18-base DNA barcodes using the subassembly method [Hiatt et al.]. Barcodes were sequenced and counted for each of four time points in two replicates, and the barcode counts were used to quantify variant enrichment/depletion.","extraMetadata":{},"keywords":["subassembly","U-box","E3","Phage display","doped oligo synthesis","ubiquitin"],"urn":"urn:mavedb:00000004-a","numScoreSets":3,"createdBy":{"orcidId":"0000-0003-1474-605X","firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Rubin"},"modifiedBy":{"orcidId":"0000-0003-1474-605X","firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Rubin"},"creationDate":"2018-10-14","modificationDate":"2019-07-28","publishedDate":"2018-12-03","experimentSetUrn":"urn:mavedb:00000004","doiIdentifiers":[],"primaryPublicationIdentifiers":[],"secondaryPublicationIdentifiers":[{"identifier":"23509263","id":5,"url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23509263","referenceHtml":"Starita LM, <i>et al</i>.
