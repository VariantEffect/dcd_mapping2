{"title":"CCR5 HIV binding","methodText":"Data obtained from sorting cells for both surface expression and HIV-1~BaL~ gp120-CD4 interaction was analysed using Enrich (version unspecified). Log~2~ enrichment ratios were calculated and normalised by subtracting the frequency of the WT sequence. Log~2~ enrichment ratios for two replicates were averaged to obtain variant scores. Note that the scores here were not reported in the manuscript tables, but were calculated from the replicate enrichment ratios that were reported.","abstractText":"This experiment utilised site-saturation mutagenesis (SSM) to measure the functional consequences of mutations in the human chemokine receptor, CCR5 and to map ligand interaction sites.
