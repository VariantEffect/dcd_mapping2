{"title":"Exonic splicing for hnRNP D binding site","methodText":"Reads were filtered by accepting only those that had an unmutated 6nt stretch at the end of the read and had no mutations other than those that were designed. FASTQ quality scores were not used.\r\n\r\nThe sum of the reads in each of the two replicate transfections was used to calculate the scores, defined as the ratio of RNA read count to DNA read count (called the Enrichment Index, or EI).\r\n\r\nThe score reported here is the “LEIsc”, which is $log_2 EI$ re-scaled from -1 to +1 with the target sequence at 0, which enables easier comparison between the different 6-mers tested in the study.","abstractText":"Saturation mutagenesis was conducted to determine the role of exonic sequences in splicing of a human RNA transcript. Minigene variants were assayed for splicing in human HEK293 cells. Ten different variant minigenes were tested, each differing by a six-nucleotide sequence at positions 5-10 in the exon.

Variant minigenes were constructed using primer extension PCR. The microarray wild type clusters were present in a higher number to provide the denominator sufficient for later analysis. The 3’ end of the 60-mer was constant and the remaining 47 nucleotides were specified as wild type or variants of WT-1 exon 5. The full minigene library was constructed by three-fragment overlap extension PCR and transfected into HEK293 cells.\r\n\r\nTwo independent transfections were performed.\r\n \r\nInput DNA and reverse-transcribed RNA were amplified and prepared for sequencing. Sequencing was carried out using Illumina with 74 base pair reads.","extraMetadata":{},"urn":"urn:mavedb:00000083-e","createdBy":{"orcidId":"0000-0003-1474-605X","firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Rubin"},"modifiedBy":{"orcidId":"0000-0003-1474-605X","firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Rubin"},"creationDate":"2021-10-28","modificationDate":"2021-10-28","publishedDate":"2021-10-28","experimentSetUrn":"urn:mavedb:00000083","scoreSetUrns":["urn:mavedb:00000083-e-1"],"doiIdentifiers":[],"primaryPublicationIdentifiers":[{"identifier":"29242188","dbName":"PubMed","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29242188","referenceHtml":"Ke S, <i>et al</i>.
